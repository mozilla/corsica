## An Absolute Beginner's Guide to Corsica on the Raspberry Pi
###### rev 0.8

Corsica is an extensible digital signage solution that can be implemented on most \*nix (Unix-like) systems. It consists of a server and display clients. Client machines do not require special software and simply run any modern web browser, although everyone on the Corsica team does highly recommend [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com).

The server consumes very few resources and will happily run on a Raspberry Pi or other very small machine. A Corsica server running on a Raspberry Pi 3+ can easily support more than 100 client displays. These instructions are written specifically for a Raspberry Pi running the Raspian operating system (a Debian derivative); they will also work on almost all \*nix systems. These instructions also assume you are using the [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com) browser. Most other modern browsers should also work.

As the title above indicates, these instructions are designed for someone with very little knowledge of Corsica or its underlying technologies (Node.js and Javascript). If you're a Node Ninja, see the .md files in the system and the Javascript code itself. Also, if your are a Node Ninja, please consider creating a plug-in to enable Corsica to do something new and awesome.

For the rest of us, we hope these instructions will show you how to configure Corsica through the command line. If you have a keyboard and monitor connected to your Raspberry Pi, you get to the command line via the terminal application.  Without a keyboard and monitor you can get to the command line over the network using SSH.  For more information on how to enable SSH see the [Raspian SSH documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md).

You'll need to know know the DNS name or the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. The default name on most LANs will be raspberrypi.local. If that doesn't work, there are instructions in the [Raspian documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md) that will help you discover it.

### Installation

Corsica uses  [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). To install these on a Raspberry Pi first check the version of the processor in your system:

	uname -m
	
If the result starts with armv6, see this [blog post](http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/). For Raspberry Pi 3 systems and others with armv7 and later processors:

	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
	sudo apt install nodejs

If you're unfamiliar with Node, you can learn more at [nodesource.com](http://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/).

Make sure git is installed on your system.  To install git on a Pi:

	sudo apt-get install git

If you're unfamiliar with git, you can learn more with Atlassan's [git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

Once you've got git installed, we'll use the git clone command to create a directory called corsica and get the code from GitHub:

  
    git clone https://github.com/mozilla/corsica.git


Then change to the new corsica directory, copy two files and install Corsica:    

    cd corsica
    cp config.json .env
    cp state.json.demo state.json
    npm install    

You can verify that you've got everything in place by running the tests:

    npm test

You can start the server with:

    npm start

and ctrl-C to stop it.

You can use the npm start command in a screen session to test your installation, but for production use it makes more sense to run Corsica in the background so it will run unattended.  If you already have a process manager running on your machine, you can use that.

There's not a default process manager on the Raspberry Pi, but we can use the [Forever NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to do the job.

	sudo npm install forever --global

On a Pi you will see two warning messages about skipping optional dependencies. You can safely ignore these.

Using nano or whichever text editor you prefer, edit the "scripts" entry in package.json so it looks like this:

	"scripts": {
    	"test": "find tests -name '*_test.js' | xargs -n 1 -t node",
		"start": "node index.js",
		"corsica-server": "forever start --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 index.js",
		"close-server":  "forever stop index.js"
    },

Don't forget to add the comma at the end of the "start": line.

Now you can start Corsica in the background with:

	npm run corsica-server

and stop the background instance with:

	npm run close-server


### Customizing

Your set up will probably need some customization. There are two kinds of customization in Corsica: configuration and settings. Configuration is mostly static and used by the core. Settings are dynamic and used mostly by plugins.  More on settings later.

### Configuration

Configuration comes from the environment, and is for very static things such as the port to listen on, or the plugins to load. There are three sources for config:

1. **lib/config.json** - This is where the defaults are stored, and a good place to see some of what can be configured. You shouldn't change values here. Leaving config.json untouched lets you return easily to the original default configuration if your installation goes pear shaped. Simply re-copy config.json to .env as you did above and your installation will be back to the defaults.

		cp config.js .env

2. **.env** - If the hidden file named .env is in the Corsica directory settings there are loaded as if they were from the environment. The syntax is one configuration per line, e.g. `PORT=8080`. If the values here are valid JSON, they will be parsed as such. Settings here will override the defaults in `lib/config.json`.  The .env file initially specifies the port number on which Corsica listens, and the plugins used by the system. 

3. **Environment variables** - You can put configuration information in system environment variables if you prefer.  If you're unfamiliar with environment variables it's safe to ignore this option.

Plugins can be specified as one of these settings. Only specified settings will be loaded, regardless of what could be loaded. Corsica will first try to load plugins from the local `/plugins/` directory, and then from its npm dependencies folder. If the plugin cannot be found an error will be logged at startup.


### Connecting Display Screens

Once you start Corsica it will run a web server on port 8080 of your machine unless you've changed the port number in the .env file.  You'll need to know either the hostname or the IP address of your Pi.  The default name for a new Raspberry Pi installation is raspberrypi.  If you haven't changed it you can just open a browser on your display client machine and browse to:

	http://raspberrypi.local:8080

You should see the yellow and black Corsica logo.  A bubble will pop up with the Corsica name of your client.  You can (and should) change the name of your client to something that indicates the location of this particular display screen.   The easiest way to do this is
to use Mathew ["Potch"](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/potch/) Claypotch's corsica-repl.  (Potch is a principal developer of Corsica, and he's promised to put repl into the core of Corsica sometime soon).

Open a browser tab and browse to:

	http://potch.github.io/corsica-repl?server=http://raspberrypi.local:8080/

We'll use "TestClient" as the name of the client display for the rest of this tutorial. Go to the dropdown in the lower right corner of the screen and find the client name that popped up.  Then in the command line at the bottom left of the screen type:

	admin type=rename name=TestClient

Leave the corsica-repl tab open and switch to browser tab showing the Corsica logo and refresh the page. You'll see the new name in the pop-up bubble. 


### Adding Content

Just displaying the Corsica logo isn't very useful, so we need to add some content.  That's done in a file named state.json.  That file wasn't installed when you cloned the git repository.  

There was, however,  a file named state.json.demo.  Go back to the Raspberry Pi command line, stop corsica, and copy that to a new file named state.json, and restart Corsica: 
	
	ctrl-C
	cp state.json.demo state.json
	npm start
	
Now if you return to the corsica client browser tab and refresh the page you should see some cartoon animals on a blue background.  The default tag in the state.json file contains a list of web page addresses.  You can present any web page this way, although the layout of some pages makes them less suited for use with Corsica.

A Corsica client displays content from one or more tags to which it subscribes.  New clients come already subscribed to a tag named "default".

Cartoon animals are cute, but let's add some useful content to the screen rotation on our test client.

Return to the corsica-repl tab and in the command line at the lower left type:

	admin type=subscribe tag=weather
	
Switch back to the display client tab and refresh the page.

A weather forecast for San Jose, California, will be added to the list of urls displayed.


Our sample state.json file contains three tags named "default", "weather" and "images".  The "images" tag contains links to more cartoon animal graphics (.png) files.  Let's add those by switching back to the corsica-repl tab and typing:

	admin type=subscribe tag=images
	
Again, return to the display client tab and refresh the page.  You'll see some new animals added to the rotation.  But notice that the new animals appear on the left edge of the page with a white background.  That's because the cartoons with the blue background are listed in state.json as urls that point to a proper web page written in html.  The new cartoons with the white backgrounds are listed in state.json as urls that just point to the .png graphics files with no enclosing html.

We can improve the way those graphics are displayed by Corsica, but to do that we'll have to "extend" Corsica itself.


### Extending Corsica

More than a dozen npm Corsica plugins are available on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/). Follow that link and enter "corsica" in the search box at the top of the page to see a list of them.

We'll use one of those npm plugins to let you display our new animals.  It's also useful to to display any image you find on the web, without displaying distracting graphics surrounding the image. 

Go to the Corsica command line, stop Corsica and install the corsica-image plugin:

	ctrl-C 
	npm install corsica-image

In addition to adding the corsica-image plugins, we need to add it to the .env configuration file's list of active plug-ins.  Open .env in nano or your preferred text editor and add corsica-image to the list there.  When you finish it should look like:

	plugins=["brain", "census", "settings", "command", "content", "timer", "namer", "glob", "tags", "corsica-image"]

Then restart corsica:

	npm start


Now go to the corsica-repl tab in your browser and subscribe to the images tag:

	admin type=subscribe tag=images

Open the corsica display client tab on your browser and refresh the page.  You should see the new animals displayed centered on the screen with a dark blue background. 

### Customizing Content

Lets take a look at the difference between what the urls in the default tag do and those in the images tag.

Take a look at state.json by going to the Corsica command line and typing:

	cat ~/corsica/state.json

In the "default" section of that file you will find a line that looks like:

  "https://ramilewski.github.io/corsica-support/show.html?image=kitty.png",

This url is a link to a web page with a cartoon of a kitten.  That web page displays an image, but it also supplies a background that is a gradient that starts at the top of the page as a blue color, and fades to white at the bottom of the page.  That background is created by the CSS and HTML of the web page.  It is not part of the graphic itself.

The "images" sections of the page has a line that looks like:

	 "https://ramilewski.github.io/corsica-support/bunny.png bg=#2244BB",

This is a url that specifies a link to the .png image of a rabbit. There is no actual web page for that image. The corsica-images plug-in will show the image centered in a background of the color specified in the "bg=#2244BB" argument on that line.

"#2244BB" is hexadecimal notation for a dark blue color.  For a tool to help you specify any color in hex notation see the [MDN Color Picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool).    

In displaying this line Corsica has used the corsica-images plugin to render the display.  This means that if you find an image you want to display on your Corsica client displays, you can create a line in state.json that will display just that image, but not any other distracting content of the surrounding page.  To find the url of an image in Firefox, right-click the image and select "Copy Image Location" in the context menu that appears.

The "weather" section of state.json has only one url.  This fetches a weather forecast from https://forecast.io.  But unless you live in San Jose, that forecast isn't very useful. To  get a forecast for your location you need to know it's latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
If you don't, there's a [web-based tool](https://www.latlong.net/) that will let you find it.

Right now the url in the line in state.json that specifies the weather forecast looks like:

	"https://forecast.io/embed/#lat=37.3352&lon=-121.8871&name=San%20Jose%20CA&color=#4466bb zoom=300"
	
To get the forecast for your location, change the lat and lon entries in that line and change the name to your location.  Use %20 instead of spaces in the place name.  The color parameter specifies the color of the bars between the high and low temperatures.  The zoom parameter is used to adjust the size of the forecast to fit on the display screen.

When you create your own state.json file, remember that if you have a "default" tag, any content specified in that tag will appear on any browser that connects to the server without further configuration.

##### Display Timing

At the top of state.json there are some settings that control how long each image is shown on the screen. 

	"settings::timer": {
        "resetTime": 30000,
        "jitter": 5000,
                    
All of the times are measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second).  The resetTime is the maximum time each image is on the screen before the next screen is displayed.  Jitter is multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1 and the result is subtracted from resetTime.  This provides some variety in display times.  You can set jitter to 0 if you wish.  The settings shown will set the default timing between 25 and 30 seconds.

You can also set different times for each display client:

	"settings::timer": {
	        "resetTime": 30000,
	        "jitter": 5000,
	        "resetOnConnect": true,
	        "screens": {
	            "TestClient": {
	                "resetTime": 10000,
	                "jitter": 1000
	            }
	        }
	    },

Here we've set the display time for our TestClient to between 9 and 10 seconds.  

### Conclusion.

We've shown how to install and configure a Corsica server on a Raspberry Pi. With what you've learned here, you can build a versatile, very low cost digital signage system.

You can use Raspberry Pis not only as the server in your system, but also to drive client displays.

There are many more plugins on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/) that you can use to add other capabilities to your Corsica installation, including displaying:

* Images from Flickr
* Tweets
* Conversations in an IRC channel
* Video files
* YouTube videos
* Slides in Google presentations
* XKCD cartoons
* Content from an RSS feed
